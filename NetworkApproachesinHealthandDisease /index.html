			<h3>Scope of the satellite</h3>

            <p>Understanding the mechanisms behind the origins, development,
							evolution and resilience of diseases is one of the most important
							challenges in Contemporary Science. To do so, Medicine and the
							Biomedical sciences are supported by Physics, Mathematics and
							Computational Sciences in an emergent field known as Systems Biology.
							Here, living systems and its constituents at different levels of
							description can be seen as nodes in a network. Such nodes coexist
							with other elements under different levels of interaction. Network
							approaches are able to integrate, in a relatively easy and visually
							appealing fashion, a considerable amount of information of diverse
							classes coming from a large range of sources. Global properties of
							the networks, often provide information that can shed light upon the
							underlying emergent processes of living systems, and thus help to
							complement information ontained by biomedical research. Network Biology
							has contributed to the discovery of a myriad of different processes
							and mechanisms of biological systems at the molecular, cellular and
							physiological level, demonstrating that biologically-inspired network
							inference and analysis is a useful tool to direct basic and applied
							experimental research Goals To provide novel research in network theory
							as applied to understand the origins and development of several diseases,
							particularly focused on chronicdegenerative ones.</p>

            <h3>CALL FOR ABSTRACTS</h3>
            <p>The satellite meeting will focus on epidemic-related challenges in a fully
							interdisciplinary fashion, bringing together researchers from a broad rang...</p>

            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p>To discuss the state-of-the-art in the field of implementation of complex
							systems and network theory approaches to dissect and understand the mechanisms
							of the origin and evolution and distribution of violence from different
							points of view: social, geographical and statistical.</p>

            <h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
            <p>Submissions will be made by sending one A4 page abstract in pdf via Easychair.
							The deadline for abstract submission is 7th July 2017. The contributions to the
							event will be evaluated by the programme committee through a peer review process
							that will account for the scientific quality as well as for the relevance of the
							contribution to the aims of the satellite. The authors of accepted abstracts will
							be notified via e-mail by 14th July 2017.</p>
